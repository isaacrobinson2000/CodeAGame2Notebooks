    "\n",
    "Goals:\n",
    " - Learn what a sprite is.\n",
    " - Learn how to create sprites.\n",
    " - Learn how to load and use sprites in the game engine.\n",
    " \n",
    "As you likely have recognized, all of the `GameObjects` you have created are just rectangles. This does not make for a very exciting game. So, how can we make our characters come to life? We can do that through the use of sprites. A sprite is simply a collection of images combined into 1 image, by tiling them. \n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "To display each frame of an animation, we simply draw a single tile or section of the sprite. To move to the next frame, we just update the current tile in the sprite the drawer is pointing at. This makes sprites ideal for creating animations in games. For sprites to fully work, we need to identify a tile size, frame rate (speed to change tiles at), and which tiles are part of the animation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 1: Come up with a Game Idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin making sprites, I want you to think about the game you want to design. It could be anything you want, a basic platformer, flight simulator, soccer game, or anything else possible with the engine. One key note, don't think too big! Most modern games with lots of features are worked on by entire teams of developers and artists with years of experience, for several years on end! Also, no violence or gore, keep it PG. If you do include violence or gore, you won't be able to show your game at the end of class, and instead will present on one of the topics covered in class.\n",
