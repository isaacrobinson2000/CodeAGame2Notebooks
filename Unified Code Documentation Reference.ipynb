    "The `makeGame` function accepts one additional argument: \n",
    " - `cameraConfig`: A list or array of objects specifying the settings for the list of cameras to be used for viewing this zone. This setting is optional and not setting it causes the camera configuration to default to a single camera that tracks all players in the entered zone. The camera config objects can specify the following properties:\n",
    "    - `blockSize`: Size of a block in pixels, defaults to 32.\n",
    "    - `minBlocksShown`: A number, the minimum amount of blocks to display along the shortest axes. Defaults to 10.\n",

Specifies the box to always keep the tracked players in relative to the camera's space on screen ((0, 0) being the top left corner of the camera and (1, 1) being the bottom right corner).

Can also be a list of objects, in which case each object corresponds to the hit box with the same index as returned by `getHitBoxes`.\n",
    " - `this._movable`: Defaults to false. Indicates an object can't be moved, like blocks. If set to true, the object will be moved when collisions occur with other solid objects.\n",
    " - `this._solid`: Defaults to true. If an object is not solid, collisions will still be detected, but objects that collide with it will move right through the object."
