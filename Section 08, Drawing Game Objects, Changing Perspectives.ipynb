    "# Section 8, Drawing Game Objects, Changing Perspectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals:\n",
    " - Learn about camera space (or game space) and screen space, and how they differ. \n",
    " - Learn how to transform between them.\n",
    " - Implement code to draw your objects as rectangles.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Game Perspective: The Game Space and Screen Spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most physics based games, we typically want to be able to explore an area larger then the screen. To do this, we need to place objects in a space that is larger/offset compared to the screen. This is typically referred to as camera space, but we will refer to it as the game space. This space encompasses the entire environment of your game, including things that are off-screen! Game space never moves, it remains in a constant location.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Picture of game space and screen space in a game.](./images/ScreenSpaces.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to actually view or draw objects being moved around in game space, we must translate them to screen space. The question though is through what? Well just like how we translate objects in real life onto a screen using a camera, we will use a camera to go from game space to screen space. In reality, the camera just stores its offset (x, y) and size (width and height) in game space, and translates that to the size of the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may notice a camera already gets passed to the draw methods below. The camera provides these methods for translation. \n",
    "\n",
    " - `getBounds()`: Returns array with 4 elements (x, y, width, height), being the bounds of the camera in game space.\n",
    " - `transform([x, y])`: Accepts a length 2 array being x and y coordinates in game space, returns them in screen space.\n",
    " - `transformBox([x, y, w, h])`: Same as transform, but accepts and returns a box.\n",
    " - `reverseTransform([x, y])`: Transforms a point from screen to game space.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Task 1: Implement Preview of Objects In Editor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you know how to apply and use the camera, (and how to draw from section 6), you can write the code to draw objects. But before we do this, let's implement code so we get preview of the objects on their buttons in the level editor. Implement the code in `drawPreview` for the three objects below. Unlike the regular draw methods, the box is already given to you, so just simply draw a rectangle to that box.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final result: See items on button, but placing them shows nothing...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task 2: Implement Drawing of Object\n",
    " \n",
    "Now that you know how to apply and use the camera, (and how to draw from section 6), you can write the code to draw objects. To do this you'll need to:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Get the box of your object (hint: you can use `this.getHitBox()`).\n",
    " - Translate the box into game space using the camera (hint: `camera.transformBox()`).\n",
    " - Draw a rectangle at that location using the painter (`painter.fillRect()`).\n",
    " \n",
    "Your task is to do this for all of the objects below. Use a different colored rectangle for each one. \n",
    "\n",
    "Final result: See items on button, and placing them works."
