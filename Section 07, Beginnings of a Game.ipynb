    " - Understand the base code for the game, and key components of a game at a higher level.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have learned how to draw items to the screen, but this raises a simple question: How do we move objects on screen?\n",
    "\n",
    "In video games, we use the same trick as in film, where we show images with objects slightly moved between frames. By showing the frames rapidly (~30-60 frames a second, 24 for film), what initially looks like separate frames becomes fluid motion to the human eye. This gives the 'illusion' of motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image of a circle moving a small amount several times...](./images/AnimationExample.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Animation is done by the game loop. The game loop, as the name implies, executes indefinitely until the game is terminated. The game loop can be broken into two parts:\n",
    " - `update`: Update the locations of all loaded objects in the game. (Move them).\n",
    " - `draw`: Draw the current state of the game to the screen.\n",
    " \n",
    "This game loop runs at the same speed as the monitor refresh rate. Most monitors refresh at 60 frames per second.\n",
    " \n",
    "To begin, we can write a very simple 'game' to showcase this."

The time step is the number of milliseconds that have passed between this and the last call to the loop, and the game state object can be used to stash the current state of the game.\n",

    " - `canvas`: The canvas.\n",
    " - `painter`: The canvas painter or 2D rendering context.\n",
    " - `keysPressed`: An object which stores the key codes of all keys currently pressed down. You will use this for handling input.\n",
    " - `camera`: The camera created for the game. Converts game coordinates into screen coordinates, and can track an object.\n",
