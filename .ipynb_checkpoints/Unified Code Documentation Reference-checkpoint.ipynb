    " - `playerType`: A `GameObject` type, the type of the player, to be used as the player in the game.\n",
    " - `callbacks`: An object of functions, for doing global things during each loop. Supports the following entries in the object:\n",
    "     - `preUpdate(timeStep, gameState)`: Function is executed before anything else in the game is updated. If the function returns true, actually skips updating the game for this run of the loop. Not executed in the level editor.\n",
    "     - `postUpdate(timeStep, gameState)`: Function is executed after everything else has been updated. Not executed in the level editor.\n",
    "     - `preDraw(canvas, painter, gameState)`: Function is executed before anything else in the game is drawn to the screen. Can be used to draw a background.\n",
    "     - `postDraw(canvas, painter, gameState)`: Function is executed after everything else is drawn. Can be used for drawing indicators/overlays.\n",
    "\n",
    "`makeGame` has one additional argument at the end:\n",
    " - `minPixelsShown`: The minimum number of pixels guaranteed to be on screen by the camera. Defaults to `blockSize * 10`, or 10 blocks.\n",

    "\n",
    " - `getBounds()`: Returns array with 4 elements (x, y, width, height), being the bounds of the camera in game space.\n",
    " - `transform([x, y])`: Accepts a length 2 array being x and y coordinates in pixel game space, returns them in screen space.\n",
    " - `transformBox([x, y, w, h])`: Same as transform, but accepts and returns a box.\n",
    " - `reverseTransform([x, y])`: Transforms a point from screen to game space."

    "\n",
    "Functions:\n",
    " - `handleCollisions(obj, side)`: Triggered whenever a collision occurs between this and another `GameCollisionObject`. Passes the other object, and the side of the current object that collided with the other object (`\"left\"`, `\"right\"`, `\"top\"`, or `\"bottom\"`).\n",
    " \n",
    "Configurable Variables/Attributes:\n",
    " - `this._collisionSides`: An object literal that defaults to `{\"left\": true, \"top\": true, \"right\": true, \"bottom\": true}`. By setting it to an object with some of the above entries missing, those sides won't be checked for collisions. This allows for one-way platforms, gates, and other items.\n",
    " - `this._movable`: Defaults to false. Indicates an object can't be moved, like blocks. If set to true, the velocity of an object must be stored in `this._vx` and `this._vy`. This is because velocities get automatically zeroed for you when you collide with objects in that direction.\n",
    " - `this._solid`: Defaults to true. If an object is not solid, collisions will still be detected, but objects that collide with it will move right through the object."
